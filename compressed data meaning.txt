First 8 bits	->	Number of different characters in frequency list


Repeat sequence 40 x (First 8 bits):
Next  8 bits	->	Unique character string
Next 32 bits	->	Number of occurences of unique character string


Repeat sequence until finished:
Next  5 bits	-> 	Number of bits ahead the starting point of huffman code
				Bits between represent dictionary index
-Decode huffmancode into binary string
-Insert binary string together with dictionary index into dictionary 
 for Lempel-ziv decoding
